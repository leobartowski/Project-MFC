# Multivariable Feedback Control Projecy

This repo contains a robust controller for the lateral flight dynamics of an aircraft. 
<br><br>
The proposed control is designed in such a way as to stabilize an aircraft that is initially in an unstable position assumed by us.
<br><br>
The realized systems are: 
- a controller with state feedback to stabilize the aircraft i.e., bring it to an equilibrium attitude
- an observer to estimate the state, on which a dynamic controller was built so as to recover the guarantees obtained from the state feedback
- a controller and an estimator with set point
